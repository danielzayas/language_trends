## Programing Language Trends

Programming language popularity over time, as measured by the # of `git push` to Github:

## Data

`languages.csv` data through 2024 Q3 was sourced from https://github.com/github/innovationgraph/blob/main/data/languages.csv on 2024-03-23 around 11pm PT.

I also create a new Issue https://github.com/github/innovationgraph/issues/47 to as for more recent data (2024 Q4, 2025 Q1, etc.).

## Acknowledgements

1. Github for publishing the CSV. Y'all should really improve the data visualization on your https://innovationgraph.github.com/global-metrics/programming-languages page though.
2. @madnight for creating a beautiful UI under the AGPL 3.0 license at https://github.com/madnight/githut, but sadly the last quarter in the data source is 2024 Q1.

## Open Questions

Filterting https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pushes/2024/1, which is powered by https://github.com/madnight/githut, for "PUSHES" through 2024 Q1 tells a very different story about language trends. For example, consider 2024 Q1. Github's `languages.csv` has JavaScript at 18% of pushes versus @madnight's data source has JavaScript at 11% of pushes. Why the large discrepancy?:
